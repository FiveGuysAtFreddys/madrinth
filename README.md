This is a fork of the modrinth app without ads.
(to modrinth: if you have a problem with this idc)

I'm working on some custom features like:
- [ ] Import from another modpack (so if you create a new modpack you can just import some mods from one of your existing modpacks)
- [ ] Create updated version of pack (so like duplicate but with diffrent version)
